# Palestine Resilience Study

## Node of Articulation: Synthesis Pillar
This repository serves as the **Synthesis & Literature Pillar** for the [Palestine Resilience Field](https://github.com/Dours-d/Palestine-resilience-field). It bridges academic research with actionable market components.

## Project Goal
This repository provides a reproducible data analysis framework for studying resilience in Gaza and the West Bank. It aims to synthesize public health, socio-economic, and psychological research to identify key resilience factors and inform evidence-based support strategies.

## Articulation with the Field
The Study node identifies products and services (academic, artisanal, or health-related) that are fed into the Field's `master_inventory.json` for platform deployment.

## Primary Users
Researchers, data scientists, NGO analysts, and students interested in Palestinian studies, conflict resilience, and public health data.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
A set of Jupyter notebooks that:
1.  Curate and tag key academic literature on Palestinian resilience.
2.  Analyze and visualize publicly available datasets on health, infrastructure, or quality of life.
